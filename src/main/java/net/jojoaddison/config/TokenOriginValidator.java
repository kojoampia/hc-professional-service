/**
 * Rejects tokens minted for a different Health Connect product.
 *
 * <p>The HMAC signing key is shared with hc-admin and hc-patient — one key, three products, by design, so that a
 * session works across them. The consequence nobody chose is that a token minted by any one of the three verifies
 * perfectly here, carrying whatever authorities it was given.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Why that matters in this service specifically.</b> Every own-scoped read resolves the caller by matching
 * {@code Profile.accountId} against the token's {@code sub} — the login. {@code OnboardingResource.currentAccountId},
 * {@code DutyRosterResource.ownProfileId} and {@code MessagingResource.caller} all say so. That is the right design
 * given one identity provider, and there are three. hc-patient grants {@code ROLE_USER} alongside
 * {@code ROLE_PATIENT}, and {@code ROLE_USER} is exactly what an applicant here holds, so its token passes the
 * {@code .authenticated()} onboarding island — and if its {@code sub} equals a professional's login, it resolves to
 * that professional. Logins are human-chosen and registration on the sibling stack is self-service, so nothing has to
 * be guessed. See {@code docs/backlog.md} item 27.</p>
 *
 * <p>The gateway has stamped {@code iss} and {@code aud} since 2026-09-06. This is the other half: the check that
 * makes them mean something.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a port of hc-patient's validator of the same name, deliberately kept identical in shape. Three products
 * telling each other apart is not a place for three different mechanisms.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why it is off by default</h2>
 *
 * <p>Turning this on rejects every token that lacks the claims — which is every token in flight at the moment it is
 * switched on, and every token the sibling products issue until they emit their own. Enabled on the day it ships it
 * would sign out every user of this stack at once.</p>
 *
 * <p>The properties live under {@code application.*} rather than {@code jhipster.*} deliberately: JHipsterProperties
 * binds with {@code ignoreUnknownFields = false}, so an extra key under its prefix does not get ignored — it fails
 * the whole context startup with an unbound-property error.</p>
 *
 * <p>So it ships disabled and is enabled per environment with
 * {@code application.security.jwt.validate-origin=true}, once:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the gateway's claims have been live longer than the longest token lifetime — 30 days, the JHipster
 *       remember-me window — so no valid token predates them; and</li>
 *   <li>hc-admin and hc-patient emit their own {@code iss}/{@code aud}, or are accepted here by adding their issuers
 *       to {@code trusted-issuers}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A flag makes that a one-line config change per environment and an instant rollback, rather than a code release
 * on the day something goes wrong.</p>
